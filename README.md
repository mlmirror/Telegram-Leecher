 - Limited Disk Storage in Free Colab Account ~84 GB 
 <!-- - Which Limits the zip process of files size to ~41 GB
 - Have to manually upload config files ( token.pickle, thmb.jpg, etc ) -->

## **🪲 Known Bugs**

 - Video Splitting is not supported  yet
 - Links are only taken from Notebook. Bot Commands are not available till now

## **🚨 NOTE:**
 - Magnet or Torrent Links are supported, But avoid using, because `Google Colab Stricly Prohibits Torrents`
 - Downloading `YouTube Video without permission of the owner` can lead to copyright issues. Use with Caution
